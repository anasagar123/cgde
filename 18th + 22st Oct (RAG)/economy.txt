Last month, when India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the BRICS National Security Advisers’ meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, a possibility was born anew. Is our diplomatic engagement with China, strained since the horrific June 2020 Chinese incursion into Galwan Valley that claimed the lives of 20 Indian soldiers, about to improve? India faces this question at a time when its relations with the United States have been thriving, with the U.S. regarding India as a useful partner to counter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific. So, must India again face a crucial choice in a bipolar world?

My answer would be a qualified yes. Yes, because two major powers, the U.S. and China, are again vying for global hegemony; but qualified, because this is not the bipolarity we knew during the Cold War. After all, the U.S. and China have multiple connections with each other that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. did not: the U.S. is the largest investor in China’s economy, China owns more U.S. Treasury Bonds than any other country, the U.S. sends more tourists to China than to any other Asian country, and there are more Chinese students in the U.S. than those of any other nationality. These are two powers at odds, but with multiple avenues of diplomatic dialogue and economic co-operation that simply did not exist during the Cold War.
