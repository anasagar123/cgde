Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday (October 21, 2024) accused the BJP of being the “biggest enemy” of Maharashtra’s farmers, asserting that the only way farmers would benefit was by removing the “double engine” government from power. This remark comes as Maharashtra heads to Assembly elections on November 20, with the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance ramping up its campaign to challenge the ruling Mahayuti alliance led by the BJP.

In a post on X, Mr. Kharge criticised the BJP’s handling of the State’s agricultural sector, highlighting rising farmer suicides and accusing the party of making hollow promises. He referred to the BJP’s pledge to make Maharashtra drought-free as a mere “jumla” (empty rhetoric). “Twenty thousand farmers have committed suicide. There has been a huge cut in agricultural funding, and the ₹20,000 crore water grid promise was false,” he added.
