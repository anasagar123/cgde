-->  DRAM(dynamic ram) chips are widely used in digital electronics where low-cost and high-capacity computer memory is required.
---> SRAM(static RAM) is commonly used for a computer's cache memory, such as a processor's L2 or L3 cache.
---> A CD-ROM(Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) is a type of computer optical disc storage medium that stores data in the form of text, graphics, 
     video, and audio files. It is usually used for storing large amounts of data such as games, applications, or multimedia content. The acronym stands 
     for Compact Disc Read-Only Memory.
---> A USB drive, also referred to as a flash drive or memory stick.
---> RAM is volatile memory that temporarily stores the files you are working on. ROM is non-volatile memory that 
     permanently stores instructions for your computer.
---> Memory-mapped I/O uses the same address space to address both main memory and I/O devices
----> modulator = digital to analog
--->  Demodulator = analog to digital
--->  for sop:
      m(minterm)(sop)= (A=1,A'=0)
      M(maxterm)(pos) = (A=0,A'=1)
----> Boolean Expression formed = 2**2**n   (n means how many variables)
----> Input combination = 2**n
--->  For BFS(Breadth First Search) & Radix sort = Queue
--->  For DFS(Depth First Search) = Stack
--->  polish notation = prefix
--->  Reverse polish notation = postfix
--->   CONSTRUCTOR :
      A constructor is a special member function of a class and shares the same name as of class.
      Constructor is called by the compiler whenever the object of the class is created.
      		Important Points about Constructors :
     Access specifiers
Constructors can be defined as public, protected, or private as per the requirements. By default or default constructors, which are created by the compiler are declared as the public. 

Inheritance
As a derived class can access all the public properties of the base class, it can call its constructor also if it is not declared as private. Also, the constructor's address cannot be referenced.

virtual
Constructor in C++ cannot be declared as virtual because when we declare any function of a class as a virtual function

		There are four types of constructors in c++

	Default constructor
	Parameterized constructor
	Copy Constructor
	Dynamic Constructor

	DESTRUCTOR in C++?
Destructor is just the opposite function of the constructor. A destructor is called by the compiler when the object is destroyed and its main function is to deallocate the memory of the object.

Destructor are the last member function called for an object and they are called by the compiler itself.
If the destructor is not created by the user then compile creates or declares it by itself.


----->  INSERTION = <<

--->  Multiplexer = multiple input and single output
--->  DeMultiplexer = single input and multiple output
--->  Simplex = one way communication (mouse,keyword)
--->  Half duplex = two way communication but once at a time(wakie tokey).
--->  Full duplex = two way communication at a time
---> Half adder (XOR,AND gate),two binary digit
---> Full adder (AND, OR and XOR gates), three binary digit at a time
---> ping = check network connectivity (network me koi error to nhi,signal aa raha hai ki nhi)

---> Direct search = Hashing
---> pop(post office protocol) port number =110
---> Rom = Read only memory
---> bios and rom = firmware
---> embedded system = mobile,laptop etc.

---> htttp = basis on the request response,
---> smtp = for sending the mail
---> pop3 and imap = receive mail
---> pop3 = client or download
---> mime = non text format me file ko download karne ke liye
---> tcp = connection oriented
---> udp = conncetion less
-->  telnet = remote protocol
---> FTP = download upload from web server,mail me use nhi karte

	FIRST GENERATION(mid 1940)
        (vaccum tube(valves),machine language,cost very high)

	SECOND GENERATION(1956)
	(vaccum replaced by transistor, Assembly language,faster and reliable)

	THIRD GENERATION(1964)
        (Integrated circuit,silicon semiconductor,C and COBOL programming language,keyword monitor)

	FOURTH GENERATION(1971)
	(Microprocessor chip,oops and sql,high processing speed,reliability)

	FIFTH GENERATION (Present and future)
	(AI,natural language,quantum,molecular,Nano)
