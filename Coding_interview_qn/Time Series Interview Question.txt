			Time Series Forecasting Question :
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Time Series Forecasting ?
------> Time Series Forecasting means future Prediction of events through a Sequence of Time.

(2) Things to be followed while working on Time Series Analytics & Forecasting?
	(i) Every data should be numeric in nature, not in categorical
	(ii) Data type - one column would be datetime and second would be target variable, Both should be numeric type and datetime column make as a index
	(iii) Data should be in a Sequential order (TimeSeries always in an ascending order)
	(iv)  There should be not be any missing data in TimeSeries Forecasting. If yes, first Impute the missing data and then try Time Series Forecasting.
        ----> No Missing data is allowed in TimeSeries Forecasting as data is in order.
        ----> It is simply not Possible to shift the series to fill the gap.
	(v) Before building TimeSeries Forecasting, we have to check data component - Trend/Seasonality/error(Irregular)
         ---> Through Decomposition(Visualization) we have to check the data is Trend/Seasonality/error(Irregular)
  

(3) Smoothing/Neural Network data/ Naive Forecast?
----->  A Series with no Trend or no Seasonality that means Smoothing data.
----->  We have to solve Smoothing data by the help of moving average method.

    (i) Winter's model/1960/single exponential smoothing
      --> No Trend & No Seasonality

    (ii) Holt's model(double exponential smoothing model) :-
     ---> Here Trend but no Seasonality

    (iii) Winter & Holt's model/Multiple exponential smoothing
     ---> Here Trend & Seasonality

(4) Component of Time Series ?

	(i) Trend(Long Term movement) :
          --> More then a year
          --> deonted by T
          --> When the series increases or decreases over the length of time

      (ii) Seasonality(St) - short time - 1 year
          ---> It reflects upward & downward  movement over a time period. like AC price, Ice cream price etc

      (iii) Cyclicity(Ct) - It looks like the same as seasonality only difference is it is more then a year.

      (iv) Irregular/Random/Noisy - We can't Predict. like earth quake, Terroist attack etc

(5) Time Series Forecasting Algorithms ?
---->(i) ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
         ARIMAX(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with external factor)
     (ii) SARIMA (Seasonality Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
     (iii) AR - Auto Regressive
     (iv)  Winter's model/1960/single exponential smoothing
     (v)   Holt's model(double exponential smoothing model)
     (vi)   Winter & Holt's model/Multiple exponential smoothing   etc...

(6) Explain ARIMA MODEL?
-----> Arima model Stands for Auto Regressive Integrated moving average model.
-----> Before Building the ARIMA MODEL, we have to check our data is Stationary or not.
-----> ARIMA Model Based on Three Parameter(p,d,q) :
        p = Partial AutoCorrelation = Calculate by Auto Regressive method
        d = difference value(Stationary)
         Rule :- Time series Forecasting we can predict only when data is Stationary.
    Q.  How we know data is Stationary or not?
        ---> By Integrated method

      q = AutoCorrelation
      ---> Algorithm = moving average

     pdq =Auto Regressive Integrated  moving average

(7) Holt Winters vs Arima Model?
	
	Holt Winters                  			ARIMA MODEL
 --> data is type of Trend & Seasonality              -----> Before Building the Arima model we have to make data Stationary
---> Holt Winters Model is easy to use and            -----> ARIMA model based on three parameter
     easy to repeat for several period                        P = Partial Autocorrelation
  							      d = difference value
							      q =  AutoCorrelation

(8) Why do we need to make our data stationary only in ARIMA?
---> because we have to check mean value will be constant,variance and Standard deviation will be constant.
---> Stationary means,data is statically significant(alternative hypothesis)
----> If P <=0.05, means my data is alternative hypothesis testin
----> Method to check data is Stationary or not - "Augmented Dickey Fuller Test"

(9) What are the different ways to make our data stationary?
----> The most common would be Differencing(one level or seasonal differencing)

(10) What method can be used on Non Stationary Data?
---> Winter's model/1960/single exponential smoothing
      --> No Trend & No Seasonality

(11) Test for Stationarity in ARIMA model?
-----> Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

(12) Explain Autocorrelation, ACF and PACF in Time series Analysis?





(13) Error metrics for time series?
-----> Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Percentage Error (MPE), andMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

(14) Multivariate Time Series Model?
----> Random Forest, VAR, LSTM

(15) Time Series vs Regression?
-----> The biggest difference is that time series regression accounts for the autocorrelation between time events, which always exists.
