ðŸ”¹What is Generative AI? How is it different from traditional AI?
ANS :
	---> traditional AI (predict labels, like Random Forest, Decision tree)
	---> Generative AI ( Generate new text, like transformer(GPT,BERT,Diffusion model)

ðŸ”¹How do you reduce hallucinations in generative text models?
ANS :
	---> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	---> Prompt Engineering

ðŸ”¹How do you handle context length limitations in RAG?
ANS :
	---> LLM Models have some problem in terms of tokens.
	---> handle contet length i need to work on chunking documents (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)

ðŸ”¹How do you evaluate the accuracy and relevance of a RAG-based systems?
ANS :
		RETRIEVAL EVALUATION
	---> Recall@K - How many of the top-k retrieved chunks the correct or relevant information 
	---> Precision@K - How many of the top-k retrieved  chunks are actually useful or related to the query
	---> Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - Measures the position of the first relevant documents in the ranked list.

		GENERATION EVALUATION
	---> Through BLUE and ROUGE

ðŸ”¹How to secure data in gen ai application ?.
ANS : 

		---> use Private or on-premise LLMs
		---> Secure Data Transmission - use TLS/HTTPS for all API communications.
		---> Secure Vector Database - Faiss and Pinecone are secure vector database
                                              Consider encrypting embeddings and avoid storing raw text alongside.

ðŸ”¹Temperature?
ANS :

		---> Temperature is use for accuracy and creativity.

		        TWO TYPES OF TEMPERATURE IS THERE :
		--->(i) Low Temperature (0 to 0.3) - it is used for accuracy.it will pick most 
                                                  likely next word.it is used for summarization and fact extraction. 
                                                  e.g : what is capital of India.
		--->(ii) High Temperature (0.8 to 1.5) - it is used for creativity. e.g: story generation

ðŸ”¹Top-K Sampling :
ANS :
		---> it will give top k most likely words.

ðŸ”¹Top-p Sampling :
ANS :
     		---> it will give probability likely words.
