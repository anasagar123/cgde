ðŸ”¹ How do you tune hyperparameters?
ANS :
	---> i have tune hyperparameter through grid search and randomized search.

			 Hyperparameters :
		--> Learning rate - How much a model updates its weight during training.
		--> max_depth
		--> Criterion
		--> max_features
		--> n_estimator - no of decision trees in Random Forest, 
                                  no of boosting rounds in XGBoost

ðŸ”¹What is grid Search and Randomized Search?
ANS :
	---> Grid Search - Tries all combination from predefiend sets.
	---> Randomized Search - Randomly selects combinations. it is fast compare to grid search.


ðŸ”¹ What is difference between training,validation and test?
ANS :
	---> Training - Training time i will give input and output both data which through our model can find the 
			relation/pattern between input and output.
	---> Test - Testing time i will give only input data, model will give output data.
	---> Validation - prevent overfitting problem through tune hyperparameter.
